Introduction
This assignment will help you to understand the key concepts learnt in this session.

Problem Statement
1. Say True or False for the below statements:
• Prescriptive Analytics used to predict the future outcomes?
Answer: TRUE
Prescriptive (optimization and simulation) Analytics is used to determine the possible outcomes on “What should we do?” rather “What has happened?” which is done in Predictive Analysis
• Base R packages installed automatically?
Answer: TRUE
R Base package is automatically installed at the time of R Programming Environment setup. 

2. What is Recycling of elements in a vector?
Recycling of elements in a vector means that when an operation is performed on two different vectors of different length, elements of the shorter length vector repeats itself in a loop till the time it gains the length of a bigger vector, in order to complete the operation. 

3. Give an example of recycling of elements.
Example1	> c(1,2,3,4,5,6) + c(1,2)
	In case the longer vector is not a multiple of shorter vector, it will give an error message, but the 
	elements will still repeat itself in a loop or sequence to give the results:
Example2	> c(1,2,3,4,5,6) + c(1,2,3,4)
 
Expected Output
Output1		[1] 2 4 4 6 6 8
So, now c(1,2) has recycled itself  to c(1,2,1,2,1,2) to match the length of c(1,2,3,4,5,6) and the output will be c(1+1,2+2,3+1,4+2,5+1,6+2) = c(2,4,4,6,6,8)

Output2		[1] 2 4 6 8 6 8
Warning message:
In c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6) + c(1, 2, 3, 4) :
  longer object length is not a multiple of shorter object length
